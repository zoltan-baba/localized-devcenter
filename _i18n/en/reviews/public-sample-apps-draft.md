This guide aims to remedy some pain points you might experience when configuring your workflow. With the help of our Bitrise public sample apps collection, we will demonstrate how workflows should be configured, and what a successfully run build looks like.

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Up-to-date sample apps" content=" All the sample apps we provide in this guide are monitored by our developers on a weekly basis. All apps are scheduled to run between 4 and 5 on every Monday morning to see if the VM updates happening on Saturdays have disrupted the sample apps. If so, our developers fix the sample apps so that you have them as reliable reference."%}

## About triggers

With every public sample app, the primary workflow gets triggered when code is pushed to the Feature branch. If code is pushed content to the develop branch, then the deploy workflow gets triggered.

Learn more about triggering builds [here](/builds/triggering-builds/triggering-builds/).

## ios-sample-app

If you use `Xcode test for iOS` Step in you workflow, we suggest you to include the `Deploy to Bitrise.io - Apps, Logs, Artifacts` Step so that you can check the test results (`All`, `Failing` and `Passing`) in the `APPS & ARTIFACTS` tab on your Build's page.

## android-sample-app

* in your primary workflow you should have all the testing steps such as `Android Lint` and `Android Unit Test` Steps, whereas your deploy workflow should contain one of our building steps, like `Android Build` or `Gradle Runner` Steps.

## carthage-sample-app

Our `Carthage` Step is a iOS dependency manager.

* Make sure you add your `Github Personal Access Token` input in the step input field as a secret, otherwise the build will throw the following error message:

      API rate limit exceeded for 208.52.166.154. (But hereâ€™s the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.

  Make sure you insert the step BEFORE any building step in your deploy workflow.
* cocoapods - if ios dependencies mentioned?

## xamarin-sample-app

* `NuGet restore` Step is the recommended dependency manager for your [Xamarin](/getting-started/getting-started-with-xamarin-apps/) project.

## ionic-sample-app and cordova-sample-app

* `Generate cordova build configuration` step is a configuration step which generates the build.json file on which the building is based.

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Learn more about Ionic and Cordova" content=" For more information on code signing Ionic or Cordova, read this [guide](/code-signing/ios-code-signing/ionic-cordova-code-signing/).

## fastlane-ios-sample-app and fastlane-android-sample-app

## fastlane-snappy-sample-app

This workflow is configured to create screenshots of the unit test so that you can check the output in the `APPS & ARTIFACTS` tab of your Build's page.
